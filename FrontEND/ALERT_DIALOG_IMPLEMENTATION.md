# Alert Dialog Implementation for Account Deletion

## Overview
Replaced the "type DELETE to confirm" field with a professional shadcn-style Alert Dialog component for the account deletion confirmation flow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Alert Dialog Component (`components/ui/alert-dialog.component.ts`)
A complete Alert Dialog system with multiple sub-components:

- **AlertDialogComponent**: Main container with backdrop and modal positioning
- **AlertDialogHeaderComponent**: Header section for title and description
- **AlertDialogTitleComponent**: Dialog title with icon support
- **AlertDialogDescriptionComponent**: Explanatory text below title
- **AlertDialogContentComponent**: Main content area
- **AlertDialogFooterComponent**: Action buttons footer

**Features:**
- Fixed positioning with backdrop blur
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
- Smooth fade-in animation (200ms)
- Z-index 50 for proper overlay
- Responsive design
- Professional styling matching banking theme

### 2. Updated Delete Account Component

**TypeScript Changes** (`delete-account.component.ts`):
- Removed `confirmation` form field (no longer need to type DELETE)
- Added `showDeleteDialog` signal to control dialog visibility
- Replaced `onSubmit()` method with:
  - `openDeleteDialog()` - Validates account selection and balance, then shows dialog
  - `cancelDelete()` - Closes the dialog
  - `confirmDelete()` - Executes the actual deletion request

**Template Changes** (`delete-account.component.html`):
- Removed confirmation text input field
- Removed "type DELETE to confirm" requirement from checklist
- Added professional Alert Dialog at bottom with:
  - Warning icon (triangle with exclamation)
  - Clear title: "Confirm Account Deletion"
  - Descriptive text explaining permanence
  - Highlighted account details (type, number, balance)
  - Two action buttons:
    - "Cancel" (outline style)
    - "Yes, delete account" (rose-600 background with delete icon)

### 3. User Experience Improvements

**Before:**
1. Select account
2. Type "DELETE" in text field
3. Click submit button

**After:**
1. Select account
2. Click "Submit deletion request" button
3. Professional dialog appears with account details
4. User reviews information and confirms or cancels

**Benefits:**
- ✅ More professional and modern UX
- ✅ Clearer confirmation flow
- ✅ Visual emphasis on account details before deletion
- ✅ Easier to use (no typing required)
- ✅ Standard pattern users expect from modern banking apps
- ✅ Follows shadcn/ui design patterns
- ✅ Professional rose color scheme for destructive actions

## Technical Details
