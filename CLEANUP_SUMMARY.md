# Cleanup and Fixes Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. User Registration - NO APPROVAL NEEDED ✅
**Changed:** User registration now happens DIRECTLY without admin approval.

**Backend Changes:**
- `UserController.registerUser()` - Reverted to direct user creation via `userService.createUser()`
- Removed `UserRequestService` dependency from `UserController`
- Removed user deletion request endpoint `/user/request-deletion`

**Why:** Users should be able to register accounts immediately. Only bank account creation/deletion requires admin approval.

### 2. Bank Account Creation - APPROVAL REQUIRED ✅
**No changes needed** - This was already implemented correctly:
- `/account/create` → Submits request to admin
- `/account/delete` → Submits request to admin
- Admin approves → Account is automatically created/deleted

### 3. Admin Dashboard - Only Shows Bank Account Requests ✅

**Frontend Changes:**
- **Removed:** User registration/deletion requests section
- **Kept:** Bank account requests section (CREATE/DELETE)
- Updated to show only account-related pending requests

**TypeScript (`admin-dashboard.component.ts`):**
- Removed `userRequests` array
- Removed `UserRequest` interface
- Removed `approveUserRequest()`, `declineUserRequest()`, `updateUserRequestStatus()` methods
- Kept only `accountRequests` with improved typing
- Improved success/error messaging

**HTML (`admin-dashboard.component.html`):**
- Removed entire "User Registration Requests" section
- Simplified to show only "Bank Account Requests"
- Improved loading state display

**Backend (`AdminApprovalController`):**
- Removed `UserRequestService` dependency
- Removed all user request endpoints:
  - `/user-requests/register`
  - `/user-requests/delete`
  - `/user-requests`
  - `/user-requests/{id}/{status}`
- Kept only account request endpoints:
  - `/requests/create`
  - `/requests/delete`
  - `/requests/{id}/{status}`

## Current Workflow

### User Registration (No Approval)
1. User fills registration form
2. Clicks "Register"
3. Account is **created immediately**
4. User can login right away
5. ✅ **NO admin approval needed**

### Bank Account Creation (Requires Approval)
1. User logs in
2. Goes to "Accounts" section
3. Fills account creation form (account number, type)
4. Clicks "Create Account"
5. Request is submitted → shows "Account creation request submitted for admin approval"
6. Admin sees request in Admin Dashboard
7. Admin clicks ✓ Approve → account is created automatically
8. User can now see and use the account

### Bank Account Deletion (Requires Approval)
1. User goes to "Accounts" section
2. Fills deletion form (account number)
3. Clicks "Delete Account"
4. Request is submitted → shows "Account deletion request submitted for admin approval"
5. Admin sees request in Admin Dashboard
6. Admin clicks ✓ Approve → account is deleted automatically

## Files Cleaned Up

### Backend (Java)
✅ `UserController.java` - Simplified, removed user request logic
✅ `AdminApprovalController.java` - Removed user request endpoints

### Frontend (TypeScript)
✅ `admin-dashboard.component.ts` - Removed user request handling
✅ `admin-dashboard.component.html` - Removed user request UI

## Files That Can Be Deleted (Optional)

These files exist but are no longer used:

### Backend
- `UserRequest.java` (model) - No longer needed
- `UserRequestRepository.java` - No longer needed
- `UserRequestService.java` - No longer needed
- `AccountChangeRequest.java` (if it exists in model package) - Duplicate
- `AccountChangeRequestRepository.java` (if separate) - Duplicate
- `AccountChangeRequestService.java` (if separate) - Duplicate

### Frontend
- `admin-requests.service.ts` (if exists) - May be duplicate
- `account-change-request.model.ts` (if exists) - May be duplicate
- `/admin` component (if exists) - Duplicate of admin-dashboard

**Note:** These files can be safely deleted, but the system will work fine with them present (they're just not referenced anymore).

## API Endpoints Summary

- `PUT /api/admin/requests/{id}/APPROVED` - Approve request
- `PUT /api/admin/requests/{id}/DECLINED` - Decline request
