# Transaction Component Fixes - Complete

## Date: October 31, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Transfer Money Navigation Issue ✅
**Problem**: The "Transfer Money" quick action on the dashboard was navigating to `/transfer` instead of `/transactions` where the transfer functionality actually exists.

**Solution**: Updated the dashboard quick action button to navigate to `/transactions` instead of `/transfer`.

**File Modified**: 
- `FrontEND/src/app/components/dashboard/dashboard.html`

**Change**:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<ui-button variant="outline" routerLink="/transfer" class="h-24 flex-col space-y-2">

<!-- After -->
<ui-button variant="outline" routerLink="/transactions" class="h-24 flex-col space-y-2">
```

### 2. Account Selection Bug in Transfer Form ✅
**Problem**: When selecting a source account from the dropdown in the transfer form and then typing a destination account, both fields would end up with the same value in the payload. This was because the transfer form and transaction history filter were sharing the same state signals.

**Root Cause**: 
- Both the transfer form and history filter used the same `sourceAccountNumber` signal
- The `onAccountChange` method was setting both `sourceAccountNumber` and `selectedAccount`
- When the dropdown changed in either place, it would affect both components

**Solution**: Separated the state management for transfer form and transaction history:

**Files Modified**:
- `FrontEND/src/app/components/transactions/transactions.component.ts`
- `FrontEND/src/app/components/transactions/transactions.html`

**Key Changes**:

1. **Separated Signal State**:
```typescript
// Before - Shared state
sourceAccountNumber = signal<string>('');

// After - Separate state
historyAccountNumber = signal<string>('');        // For transaction history filter
transferSourceAccountNumber = signal<string>(''); // For transfer form only
```

2. **Separated Change Handlers**:
```typescript
// For transaction history filter (updates selected account and loads transactions)
onAccountChange(accountNumber: string): void {
  const account = this.accounts().find(a => a.accountNumber === accountNumber);
  if (account) {
    this.selectedAccount.set(account);
    this.historyAccountNumber.set(accountNumber);
    this.loadTransactions(accountNumber);
  }
}

// For transfer form (only updates the source account for transfer)
onTransferSourceAccountChange(accountNumber: string): void {
  this.transferSourceAccountNumber.set(accountNumber);
}
```

3. **Added Computed Value**:
```typescript
selectedTransferSourceAccount = computed(() => {
  return this.accounts().find(a => a.accountNumber === this.transferSourceAccountNumber()) || null;
});
```

4. **Updated HTML Template**:
   - Transfer form now uses `transferSourceAccountNumber()` and `onTransferSourceAccountChange()`
   - History filter uses `historyAccountNumber()` and `onAccountChange()`
   - Transfer form displays account info using `selectedTransferSourceAccount()`

5. **Updated Transfer Logic**:
   - All references in `onTransfer()` method now use `transferSourceAccountNumber()` instead of `sourceAccountNumber()`
