## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Framework:** Angular 19 (Zoneless)
- **State Management:** Signals (reactive)
- **Computed Values:** For transaction summaries
- **Lazy Loading:** Component loaded on demand
- **Route Protection:** authGuard (JWT required)

### API Integration
```typescript
// Transfer money
POST /transaction/transfer
Body: { sourceAccountNumber, destinationAccountNumber, amount }

// Get transactions
GET /transaction/get-transactions?accountNumber={id}
Response: { success: true, data: Transaction[] }

// Get user accounts
GET /user/profile
Response: { accounts: Account[] }
```

### Services Used
- `TransactionService` - Transfer and get transactions
- `UserService` - Get user profile (accounts)
- `AuthService` - Authentication and JWT headers

### Data Flow
```
1. User loads /transactions page
2. Component fetches user accounts (UserService)
3. Auto-selects first account
4. Loads transactions for selected account (TransactionService)
5. User can:
   - Switch to Transfer tab → Fill form → Submit → API call → Success/Error
   - Stay on History tab → Search/Sort → Real-time filtering
6. After transfer: Reload accounts → Switch to History → Show new transaction
```
