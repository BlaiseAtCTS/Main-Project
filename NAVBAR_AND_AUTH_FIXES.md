# Navigation and Authentication Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Navbar Not Updating After Logout
**Problem:** After logout, the navbar would sometimes show the wrong navigation (admin nav after user logout or vice versa).

**Root Cause:** 
- The `currentUser$` observable in the nav component wasn't properly triggering when logout occurred
- localStorage items (token, role) weren't being completely cleared
- Change detection wasn't forcing UI update after logout

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `logout()` method in `auth.service.ts` to clear both `token` and `role` from localStorage
- Updated `nav.component.ts` logout method to:
  - Clear localStorage items explicitly
  - Reset component state (`isLoggedIn`, `isAdmin`)
  - Force change detection after navigation
  - Added console logging for debugging
- Added page reload in admin components to ensure clean state

### 2. 401 Unauthorized Error on `/api/admin/users`
**Problem:** Getting 401 error when trying to fetch users list as admin.

**Root Cause:**
- The endpoint requires `ROLE_ADMIN` authority
- Token might not be properly formatted or role not included
- Backend security configuration requires admin role for `/api/admin/**` endpoints

**Solution:**
- Enhanced error handling in `admin-users.component.ts`:
  - Added token and role validation before making request
  - Added detailed error logging with status codes
  - Check for ADMIN role before attempting request
  - Redirect to login on 401 with clear message
  - Display user-friendly error messages

## Files Modified

### Frontend

1. **auth.service.ts**
   - Enhanced `logout()` to clear both token and role
   - Added localStorage.removeItem for both items

2. **nav.component.ts**
   - Updated logout method with:
     - Explicit localStorage clearing
     - State reset
     - Forced change detection
     - Console logging

3. **admin-users.component.ts**
   - Enhanced `loadAllUsers()` with:
     - Pre-request token and role validation
     - Detailed error logging
     - Better error messages
     - Auto-redirect on 401
   - Updated `logout()` with page reload

4. **admin-dashboard.component.ts**
   - Already has proper logout implementation
   - Clears token and role

### Backend

The backend is correctly configured:
- `/api/admin/**` endpoints require `ROLE_ADMIN`
- JWT filter properly handles admin user
- Security config is correct

## Testing Steps

### Test Logout Behavior

1. **Admin Logout:**
   ```
   - Login as admin (admin/admin123)
   - Navigate to any admin page
   - Click logout
   - Verify: Redirected to login
   - Verify: Navbar shows login/register links
   - Login as regular user
   - Verify: Navbar shows user navigation (not admin)
   ```

2. **User Logout:**
   ```
   - Login as regular user
   - Navigate to dashboard
   - Click logout
   - Verify: Redirected to login
   - Verify: Navbar shows login/register links
   - Login as admin
   - Verify: Navbar shows admin navigation (not user)
   ```

### Test Admin Users Endpoint

1. **Valid Admin Access:**
   ```
   - Login as admin
   - Navigate to /admin/users
   - Should see list of users with their accounts
   - Check browser console for success logs
   ```

2. **Invalid Access:**
   ```
   - Login as regular user
   - Try to navigate to /admin/users
   - Should be redirected by AdminGuard
   ```

3. **No Token:**
   ```
   - Clear localStorage
   - Try to navigate to /admin/users
   - Should see error message
   - Should be redirected to login
   ```

## Debug Console Logs

The following console logs have been added for debugging:

### During Logout:
- "Logout clicked"
- "Logged out - state reset"
- "Admin users logout clicked" (admin pages)

### During Navigation:
- "Navigation - Role check: { role, isAdmin, isLoggedIn }"

### During User Load:
- "Loading users - Auth check: { hasToken, role }"
- "Loading all users with accounts..."
- "Request URL: ..."
- "Users data response: ..."
- "Loaded users: ..."

### On Errors:
- "Error loading users: ..."
- "Error status: ..."
- "Error message: ..."

## Common Error Messages

### For Users:

1. **"No authentication token found. Please login again."**
   - Token is missing from localStorage
   - Solution: Login again

2. **"Unauthorized. Please login as admin again."**
   - Token is invalid or expired
   - Solution: Login again as admin

3. **"Access denied. Admin privileges required."**
   - User doesn't have ADMIN role
   - Solution: Login with admin credentials

4. **"Failed to load users: Http failure response for http://localhost:8080/api/admin/users: 401"**
   - Backend rejected the token
   - Solution: Check if backend is running and login again

## Backend Requirements

The backend must:
1. Be running on `http://localhost:8080`
2. Have the admin user configured (admin/admin123)
3. Return role in JWT token payload
4. Accept Bearer token in Authorization header
5. Have `/api/admin/**` endpoints protected with `hasRole("ADMIN")`

## Additional Improvements

### Security:
- All admin endpoints validate token before processing
- Role is checked both frontend and backend
- Automatic redirect on authentication failures

### User Experience:
- Clear error messages
- Loading states
- Auto-redirect on auth failures
- Console logs for debugging

### Code Quality:
- Type-safe interfaces
- Error handling for all HTTP calls
- Consistent logout behavior across all components
