# Admin Approval Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated admin approval workflow for account creation and deletion with **minimal code changes** to existing codebase.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced `AccountRequest` Model
**File:** `banking/src/main/java/com/site/banking/model/AccountRequest.java`
- Added `accountNumber` field (String) - stores the account number for create/delete requests
- Added `accountType` field (String) - stores account type (SAVINGS, CHECKING, etc.) for CREATE requests
- Added new constructor accepting these additional parameters
- Added getter/setter methods for new fields

#### 2. Updated `AccountRequestService`
**File:** `banking/src/main/java/com/site/banking/service/AccountRequestService.java`
- Added `submitCreateRequest(Principal, String accountNumber, String accountType)` - handles account creation requests from users
- Added `submitDeleteRequest(Principal, String accountNumber)` - handles account deletion requests from users
- Added `executeApprovedRequest(AccountRequest)` - executes the actual account creation or deletion when admin approves
  - For CREATE: Creates account with $0 balance and associates it with the user
  - For DELETE: Deletes the account from database
- Injected `UserRepository` and `AccountRepository` dependencies

#### 3. Modified `AccountController`
**File:** `banking/src/main/java/com/site/banking/controller/AccountController.java`
- Injected `AccountRequestService` dependency
- **Modified `/account/create` endpoint:** Now calls `requestService.submitCreateRequest()` instead of `accountService.createAccount()`
  - Returns: "Account creation request submitted for admin approval"
- **Modified `/account/delete` endpoint:** Now calls `requestService.submitDeleteRequest()` instead of `accountService.deleteAccount()`
  - Returns: "Account deletion request submitted for admin approval"

#### 4. Enhanced `AdminApprovalController`
**File:** `banking/src/main/java/com/site/banking/controller/AdminApprovalController.java`
- Updated `updateRequestStatus()` method to call `executeApprovedRequest()` when status is "APPROVED"
- This triggers automatic account creation/deletion upon approval

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Updated Admin Dashboard Component (TypeScript)
**File:** `bankingFrontend/src/app/components/admin-dashboard/admin-dashboard.component.ts`
- Modified `loadAllRequests()` to fetch both CREATE and DELETE account requests
- Added separate API calls for:
  - `/api/admin/requests/create` - get pending creation requests
  - `/api/admin/requests/delete` - get pending deletion requests
- Combined results with an `action` field to differentiate request types
- Existing approve/decline methods already handle account requests properly

#### 2. Updated Admin Dashboard Template (HTML)
**File:** `bankingFrontend/src/app/components/admin-dashboard/admin-dashboard.component.html`
- Added new "Account Requests" section with table displaying:
  - Request ID
  - User ID
  - Account Number
  - Account Type
  - Action (CREATE/DELETE)
  - Status (PENDING/APPROVED/DECLINED)
  - Action buttons (Approve/Decline)
- Displays empty state when no account requests exist
- Uses existing styling classes for consistency

## User Experience Flow

### Before (Direct Creation/Deletion)
1. User clicks "Create Account" button
2. Account is immediately created in database
3. User sees success message

### After (Admin Approval Required)
1. User clicks "Create Account" button
2. **Request is submitted** for admin approval
3. User sees: "Account creation request submitted for admin approval"
4. Request appears in Admin Dashboard as PENDING
5. Admin reviews and approves/declines
6. Upon approval, account is created automatically
7. User can now see and use the account

## API Endpoints Summary

### User Endpoints (Modified Behavior)
- `POST /account/create` - Submit account creation request
- `POST /account/delete` - Submit account deletion request

### Admin Endpoints (Existing, Enhanced)
- `GET /api/admin/requests/create` - List CREATE requests
- `GET /api/admin/requests/delete` - List DELETE requests
- `PUT /api/admin/requests/{id}/APPROVED` - Approve request (now executes action)
- `PUT /api/admin/requests/{id}/DECLINED` - Decline request

## Database Schema
No new tables required! Used existing `account_requests` table with added columns:
- `account_number` (String)
- `account_type` (String)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] User can submit account creation request
- [ ] User receives confirmation message
- [ ] Request appears in admin dashboard
- [ ] Admin can see account number and type in request
- [ ] Admin can approve request → account is created
- [ ] Admin can decline request → account is NOT created
- [ ] User can submit account deletion request
- [ ] Admin can approve deletion → account is deleted
- [ ] Admin can decline deletion → account remains

## Migration Notes

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing accounts are unaffected
- Users can still perform deposits, withdrawals, transfers on existing accounts
- Only NEW account creation/deletion goes through approval workflow

**No Breaking Changes:**
- Same API endpoints (`/account/create`, `/account/delete`)
- Return format remains `ApiResponseDto`
- Frontend code calling these endpoints requires no changes
- Users just see different success messages

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Role-Based Access Control:** Add `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` to admin endpoints
2. **Notifications:** Email users when their requests are approved/declined
3. **Request History:** Show users their past requests and their status
4. **Batch Approval:** Allow admins to approve multiple requests at once
5. **Request Comments:** Allow admins to add notes when declining requests
6. **Initial Balance:** Allow users to specify initial balance in creation requests

## Code Quality

✅ No compile errors
✅ Minimal changes to existing code
✅ Uses existing models and repositories
✅ Follows existing code patterns
✅ Maintains backward compatibility
✅ Admin dashboard UI consistent with existing design
